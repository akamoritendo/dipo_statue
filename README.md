This  repository was dedicated as gallery of my udergraduate student's research. 

Brief story :  This research discuss about analysis of 3 dimensional modeling based on close range photogrammetry method using Free and Open Source Software.
               It means all of the process will be done using FOSS, both object reconstruction and finalizing (meshing and texturing).

Research object is iconic statue of Diponegoro University which located at Widya Puraya, UNDIP, Semarang. It has textureless characteristic with high details. 

CRP fieldwork was performed using UAV quadcopter DJI Phantom 4 Pro. 
Terrestrial data were acquired using TLS and total station.

Hope you enjoy it :)

Je vous remercie.
